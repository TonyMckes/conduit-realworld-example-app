# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld.io/) spec and API.**

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

**[Demo app](https://conduit-realworld-example-app.fly.dev/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[With Create React App](https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app/tree/create-react-app)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Other RealWorld Example Apps](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=fullstack)**

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you install and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you run the project, make sure that you have the following tools and software installed on your computer:

- Text editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `v18.11.0+`
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)
- SQL database

### Installation

To install the project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd conduit-realworld-example-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies by running the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add the required environment variables as specified in the [`.env.example`](backend/.env.example) file
3. (Optional) update the Sequelize configuration parameters in the [`config.js`](backend/config/config.js) file
4. If you are **not** using PostgreSQL, you may also have to install the driver for your database:

   <details>
   <summary>Use one of the following commands to install:</summary><br/>

   > Note: `-w backend` option is used to install it in the backend [`package.json`](backend/package.json).

   ```bash
   npm install -w backend pg pg-hstore  # Postgres (already installed)
   npm install -w backend mysql2
   npm install -w backend mariadb
   npm install -w backend sqlite3
   npm install -w backend tedious       # Microsoft SQL Server
   npm install -w backend oracledb      # Oracle Database
   ```

   > :information_source: Visit [Sequelize - Installing](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#installing) for more infomation.

   ***

   </details>

5. Create database specified by configuration by executing

   > :warning: Please, make sure you have already created a superuser for your database.

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:create
   ```

   > :information_source: The command `npm run sqlz` is an alias for `npx -w backend sequelize-cli`.  
   > Execute `npm run sqlz -- --help` to see more of `sequelize-cli` commands availables.

6. Optionally you can run the following command to populate your database with some dummy data:

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:seed:all
   ```

### Usage

#### Development Server

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server by executing the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   - Home page should be available at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000).
   - API endpoints should be available at [`http://localhost:3001/api`](http://localhost:3001/api).

#### Running Tests

To run tests, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### Production

The following command will build the production version of the app:

```bash
